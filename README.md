# Discord-AI-Bot - WIP
A conversational AI bot for Discord that interacts with users as if it were a real person. Powered by AI, this open-source bot provides natural and engaging conversations, making Discord chats more interactive and fun. Completely free to use with the Groq API but also supports the OpenAI API for those who prefer it.


> This project will soon be made!
